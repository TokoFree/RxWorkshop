 ## `Creation Operators: Just, Of, From`
 
 You could create an observable by using one of these operators.
 The difference between these three:
 - `just` : will only emitting a single value
 - `of` : could emit multiple values of same type, using variadic parameter
 - `from` : similar with `of` but using array
